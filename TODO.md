# TODO

- See all videos with recorded notes
  - Listings of each video with title, picture, and preview of text saved
    - Button for delete video and text
    - go to video by clicking on picture
    - short snippet of text saved
  - Clear all videos/notes button
- Switch between video and notes with a keystroke. Move focus between video/notes
- Move active version to Github Pages
- Move the text box to the end when adding a timestamp
- Why when not at the very end of the textarea does CTRL-D delete a letter and THEN add the timestamp to the end?
