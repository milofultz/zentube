I wanted to be able to take notes on a Youtube video without having to tab out of the window to a text editor all of the time. After seeing Josh Avanier's [Down](https://down.avanier.now.sh) and Hundred Rabbit's [Left](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/left), I realized I didn't need to do anything fancy, and in fact I preferred the minimalist layout that vanilla JS can provide.

This saves the text you write for a given Youtube video into local storage and will load it up again upon returning to the same video. Supports exporting to a text file with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> and adding automatic timestamps with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd>.

Borrowed/stole heavily from [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/) and Josh Avanier's [Down](https://down.avanier.now.sh) for code, stylesheets, and ideas.
